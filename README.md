# pondeR

`pondeR` is a simple and (will be a) powerful collection of R functions (that soon I hope will become an R package) that will provide highly customizable functions such as `performDescriptive()` for generating publication-ready descriptive statistics tables using the `gtsummary` framework.

Upcoming functions such as `performttest`, `performANOVA`, `performChis2`, `performRegression`, `plotHistogram`, `plotBar`, `plotScatter`, `performExport`, among others, will be added to the `pondeR` package. These functions contain specific parameters (a ton of them) that enables users to skip the coding and just specify what they want.

This is part of my goal to make statistical analysis a little bit easy for everyone. Also, to make my analyses transparent in terms of how I perfored the analyses, and to have a template of my results.

Huge thanks to [The R Project for Statistical Computing](https://www.r-project.org/about.html), [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/), the developers of the [gtsummary](https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/), [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/), [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), everything in the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) package, and all the dependencies I fail to mention.

More functions to come!
