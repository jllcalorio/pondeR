# pondeR

`pondeR` is a simple and powerful collection of R functions that provide highly customizable function arguments for generating publication-ready descriptive and inferential statistics tables using the `gtsummary` framework.

Upcoming functions will be added to the `pondeR` package, which contain specific parameters
that enable users to skip the coding and just specify what they want. 

This is part of my goal to make statistical analysis a little bit easy for everyone. Also, to make my analyses transparent in terms of how I performed the analyses, and to have a template of my results.

Huge thanks to [The R Project for Statistical Computing](https://www.r-project.org/about.html), [Positron](https://positron.posit.co/), [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/), the developers of the [gtsummary](https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/), [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/), [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), everything in the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) package, and all the dependencies I fail to mention.

More functions to come!
