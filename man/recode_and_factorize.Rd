\title{Recode and Factorize a Column}
\usage{
recode_and_factorize(df, column, conversion_map)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing the column to be recoded and factorized.}

\item{column}{A character string specifying the name of the column to recode.
The column must exist in the data frame.}

\item{conversion_map}{A named list or vector where names are the original values
to be replaced and values are the new values. All elements must be atomic
(character, numeric, or logical).}
}
\value{
A data frame identical to the input except that the specified column
has been recoded according to the conversion map and converted to a factor
with ordered levels.
}
\description{
This function recodes values in a specified column of a data frame according
to a provided mapping, then converts the column to a factor with ordered levels.
The recoded values appear first in the factor levels, followed by any remaining
unique values in alphabetical order.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
\enumerate{
\item Converts the specified column to character to handle mixed data types
\item Applies the recoding based on the conversion map
\item Creates factor levels with recoded values first, followed by other
unique values in alphabetical order
\item Converts the column to a factor with the specified level ordering
}
}
\examples{
# Basic usage with character recoding
df <- data.frame(
  id = 1:5,
  status = c("A", "B", "C", "A", "D")
)
map <- c("A" = "Active", "B" = "Inactive", "C" = "Pending")
result <- recode_and_factorize(df, "status", map)
levels(result$status)  # "Active" "Inactive" "Pending" "D"

# Usage with numeric to character conversion
df2 <- data.frame(
  score = c(1, 2, 3, 1, 4),
  grade = c(90, 85, 78, 92, 65)
)
grade_map <- c("1" = "Excellent", "2" = "Good", "3" = "Fair")
result2 <- recode_and_factorize(df2, "score", grade_map)

}
